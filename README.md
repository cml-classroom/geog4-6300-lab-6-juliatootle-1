* Question 2: This also works. For maps this small, sometimes making boundaries transparent can be helpful.<p>
* Question 3: Explained pretty well.<p>
* Question 4: Pretty good--since some of these have very small units (e.g., rain), you might consider how that affects the way you interpret the model coefficients.<p>
* Question 5: NICE USE OF TAB_MODEL!<p>
* Question 6: Good<p>
* Question 7: Good<p>
* Question 8: Correct<p>
* Question 9: This is OK, but the headline is really about the direction and magnitude of model coefficients, which you could have said more about.<p>
